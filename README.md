# ComfyUI OOP Nodes
This project contains a set of **ComfyUI OOP Nodes** that allow users to build detailed, object-oriented prompts with customizable visual attributes for characters, environments, and scenes. These nodes are designed to provide an intuitive way to generate and control different elements such as person attributes, hairstyles, eyes, locations, and poses. The **randomize** function allows for dynamic generation, enabling users to randomize different visual elements such as eye color, hairstyle, body shape, and more, providing endless possibilities for character creation and scene design.
